# Implementation of the famous card game Mau-Mau

## Rules
There are a lot of different rules for Mau-Mau, here are these listed I used:

- the french card deck without jokers is used
- every player gets 7 random cards
- there is one initial card on the discard pile
- only cards matching the suit or rank of the topmost card on the discard pile can be played
- cards are played on the discard pile
- if one player plays a 7, the next player needs to draw 2. If the player himself has a 7 it can be played and the next player needs to draw 4, and so on
- if one player plays an Ace, the next player is skipped
- if one player plays a Jack, he can determine the suit for the next card to be played
- if one player plays his second to last card he needs to say "Mau", else he needs to draw 2 cards
- if one player plays his last card he needs to say "Mau-Mau"
